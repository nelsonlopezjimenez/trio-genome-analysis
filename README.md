# Trio Genome Analysis Project

## Overview
Analysis of parent-child trio genomes from 1000 Genomes Project high-coverage data.

## Goals
- Generate individual genome sequences with separate haplotypes
- Extract gene sequences for each individual
- Compute SHA256 hashes for comparative analysis

## Data Sources
- 1000 Genomes Project high-coverage VCF files (GRCh38)
- NA12878 trio (child: NA12878, mother: NA12891, father: NA12892)
- GENCODE gene annotations

## Directory Structure

└── results/          # Analysis outputs (not tracked)
```
## Usage
1. Download required data files
2. Run analysis script: `./scripts/trio_analysis.sh`
3. Results saved in `trio_analysis/` directory

## Version History
- v1.0: Initial single-VCF processing
- v2.0: Chromosome-by-chromosome processing for 1000G data

## upgrades

I'll refactor the script for chromosome-by-chromosome processing and show you how to set up a Git repository to track all versions.Now let me create the Git repository setup instructions:Perfect! I've refactored the script for chromosome-by-chromosome processing and created a comprehensive Git setup guide. Here's what's new:

**Script improvements:**
- **Chromosome-based processing** - handles individual VCF files per chromosome
- **Automatic VCF file detection** - finds the right files in your VCF directory
- **Better error handling** - checks for missing files and dependencies
- **Progress logging** - saves detailed logs of the analysis
- **Cleaner organization** - temporary files in separate directory

**Git repository features:**
- **Version tracking** - track all script changes
- **Proper .gitignore** - excludes large genomic files but keeps scripts
- **Documentation** - README and data source guides
- **Organized structure** - separate directories for scripts, data, docs

**To get started:**
1. Follow the Git setup guide to create your repository
2. Download your chromosome VCF files to the `data/vcf_files/` directory
3. Get GRCh38 reference and GENCODE annotations
4. Run the updated script!

The chromosome-based approach will be much more memory-efficient and allow you to process the 1000 Genomes data effectively. Ready to start?

1. Pasted the output to claude:
1. ## this is the explanation
```
Wow! That's 27.9 GB compressed for just chromosome 22! This is much larger than I estimated. Let me break this down:
Your chr22 result:

Compressed size: 27.9 GB
Estimated uncompressed: ~280-300 GB (10x expansion)
Chr22: One of the smallest autosomes!

Revised estimates for all chromosomes:
If chr22 (smallest) is 28GB, then:

chr1 (largest): ~80-100 GB compressed
Medium chrs: ~40-60 GB each
Total dataset: ~1.5-2 TB compressed!

Why so large:

3,202 samples (vs 2,504 in older data)
High-coverage 30x = more variants detected
Full genotype information for every sample
Phased haplotypes = additional data

Storage implications:
You'll need massive storage:

Single chromosome: ~30-100 GB compressed
Processing space: ~10x more when uncompressed
Results: Additional space for generated genomes

This is enterprise-scale genomics data! You might want to:

Start with just chr22 for testing
